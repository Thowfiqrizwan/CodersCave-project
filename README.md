Coderscave Internship Project: Real Estate App

As part of my internship at Coderscave, I designed a real estate app using Figma. The project focused on creating a user-friendly and visually appealing interface, including features like property listings, search filters, and detailed property views. The design emphasizes intuitive navigation and a modern aesthetic to enhance user experience in browsing and managing real estate options.
